# SublimeSocket
##### version 1.4.0
![SS](/main.png)

**The set of API Server, KVS and Executor** for the SublimeText and more.   
Connect something to editor.  
Control EditorAPI by inputted **JSON string**.  

You can construct **the chain of filters and events** that you want to do. 


#!Notice!
the SublimeSocket for ST2 is the last version for SublimeText2.  
**I never update this plugin** for ST2.  
Because the ST3 or the other editor (e.g. Atom by github) is very good and they has future.
